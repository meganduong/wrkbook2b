                <h2>SOL LEWITT'S WALL DRAWINGS</h2>
                <img src="images/wall-drawing.png" alt="sol-lewitt-wall-drawing">
                <p>
                    Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings were achieved through the program where a set of instructions written by the artist were executed by someone else.
                    In doing this he creates a simple input-output instructional pipeline that creates a highly nuanced and multi-faceted artwork.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    I found it interesting to consider how each recipient of the instructions might interpret them differently, revealing how representation is always fractured and contingent.
                    It made me think about how computers may also exhibit this kind of nuanced fragmentation, where seemingly precise instructions can lead to varied outcomes depending on how theyâ€™re processed or contextualized.

                <h2>VERA MOLNAR'S WALL DRAWINGS</h2>
                <img src="images/molar.jpg" alt="molar-computer-drawing">
                <p> 
                Using early computers in the 1960s, Vera Molnar created her computer drawings with simple programs of just lines, shapes, and repetitions. However the artworks become nuanced through introducing deliberate deviations.
                 Eg. a curve where a straight line should be, a skipped rule, a glitch in the algorithm.
