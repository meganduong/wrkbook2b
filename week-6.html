                <h2>CLICK FARMS</h2>
                <img src="images/click-farm.png" alt="click-farm">
                <p>
                    Click farms are uncanny rooms full of phones or screens, with rows of workers tapping, swiping, liking, and following on social media—commodifying these interactions. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    Learning about click farms was very interesting to me. I've always found it unsettling to come across strange, low-effort posts on social media that are flooded with likes and bot-like comments.
                <br>
                <br>
                    What I find most striking is how click farms can manipulate perception—when something appears popular online, people are more likely to agree with its message or take it seriously, regardless of its actual value or truth.

                <h2>DATA VISUALISATION BY NATHALIE MIEBACH</h2>
                <img src="images/miebach.jpg" alt="miebach">
                
                <p>
                 In Navigating Into A New Night (2009), Nathalie Miebach uses data visualization as a language for grief. Drawing from weather data recorded during the period surrounding her father-in-law’s passing, she constructs a musical score through mixed media, translating atmospheric and emotional conditions into notations of memory, presence, and loss.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                I find it interesting how the piece is both meticulous and deeply intimate, suggesting that data, too, can hold space for feeling.

            <p>
                Artificial Killing Machine (2015) by Jonathan Fletcher Moore is a data-driven installation that transforms military transparency into an unsettling mechanical ritual. It physically reacts each time a recorded death is processed, drawing on real-time data from drone strike reports.
            <br>
            <br>
                The piece exposes the detached nature of modern warfare—how distant acts of violence and death can be reduced to an entry in a database, quietly actioned by code.
            <br>
            <br>
                I find this juxtaposition interesting—the violent, loud, barbaric nature of warfare expressed through a quiet, polite machine.
