                   People Staring at Computers (2011) is a provocative surveillance art project by Kyle McDonald that explores the intimate and often unguarded relationship between people and their machines. He performed an exhibition in a New York Apple Store where he secretly installed software on Apple computers that took photos of people as they looked at the screens.

                  <br>
                    The result is a kind of an unintentional mirror, showing how tech watches us as much as we watch it. The project confronts issues of privacy, consent and technological voyeurism, raising ethical questions about data collection, public space and the aesthetics of passive surveillance.

                    I find this interesting because when I'm on my laptop or phone, I sometimes feel like someone is watching me. It also reminds me of BeReal!

                    Social Turkers (2013) by Laura McCarthy is a performance and social experiment that turns the intimate act of dating into a public, sadistic crowd-controlled experience. Over the course of twenty dates sourced through OkCupid, McCarthy livestreamed each encounter and outsourced her social decision-making to anonymous workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    These remote participants watched in real time and texted her instructions on what to say or do, which she followed on the spot—questioning what it means to surrender control of our interactions to a disembodied collective.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    I find this project interesting as it makes you think about the performative nature of social practices like first dates—how social cues can feel shackling, controlling your actions and behaviour.
